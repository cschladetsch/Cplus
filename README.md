# Cplus

Goals and contents of this library:

* Make using C easier.
* Add reflection to C objects that you want reflection for - and no more.
* Be fast. Don't break the C ideology.
* Be easy to use, with samples and unit-tests.
* To scratch the itch of liking using C, but not liking all the hoops.
* 

To this end, the library:

* Provide a well-tested and performatn set of common containers like Vector, List and Map.
* Include tracing memory model.
* Adds C++-based IDL to generate boiler-plate C code, to make a simpler `C with classes`.
* 

The end-goal is to provide a basis for an IoT infrastructure that we can all use with
ease and confidence.
